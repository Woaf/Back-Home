# Back-Home

This is a repository for a game we made on the 2019 Global Game Jam. 

## Topic

The topic - or in other words the theme - of the GGJ19 was: Home. 

## Our Plan

We started out from the idea that home is supposed to be a place that we customize based on our experiences we gain outside in the open world.

We wanted to give the players the experience that what they do outside will affect how their home is shaped. From this, we derived the
idea that home could also mean "inner state of the soul", and how the experiences build our persona. 

This game takes you through 4 days, with different possible paths of where you want to progress further, and what Home ultimately means to you.
